Graduation rate of first-time, full-time degree or certificate-seeking students  - 2007 cohort (4-year institutions) and 2010 cohort (less-than-4-year institutions). 
The graduation rate is the rate  required for disclosure and/or reporting purposes under Student Right-to-Know. This rate is calculated as the total number of completers within 150% of normal time divided by the revised cohort minus any allowable exclusions. 
For 4-year institutions the adjusted cohort is defined by the variable GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=2 and the total completers within 150% of normal time is GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=3. GRTYPE=2 and 3 include both the bachelor's or equivalent degree/certificate-seeking subcohort and the other degree/certificate-seeking subcohort (Table gr2013).

For 2-year institutions the adjusted cohort is defined by the variable GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=29 and the total completers within 150% of normal time is GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=30 (Table gr2013).

For less-than-2-year institutions the adjusted cohort defined by the variable LINE_50 and the total completers within 150% of normal time is LINE_11 (Table gr2013_L2)

Normal time to completion -  The amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically 4 years (8 semesters or trimesters, or 12 quarters, excluding summer terms) for a bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution 
Allowable exclusions - Those students who may be removed (deleted) from the GRS cohort according to the Student Right-to-Know legislation. These include students who died or were totally and permanently disabled; those who left school to serve in the armed forces; those who left to serve with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; and those who left to serve on official church mission. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>81000</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Winter 2013-14, Graduation Rates component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used graduation rates</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used graduation rates</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVGR2013</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;100</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;51</td><td>&nbsp;22.35</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>DVIC01 - Percent admitted - total</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Percent admitted - total

These data came from the 2012-13 in-district tuition and fee variable(CHG1AY3) on the price of attendance question of the IC component.

IF institution does not charge different tuition for in-district students(CHG1AY3) from in-state students(CHG2AY3),the in-district charge would contain the same amount as the in-state (CHG1AY3=CHG2AY3).

If the institution does not vary tuition by in-district,in-state, and out-of-state(CHG3AY3), the tuition and fee amount is stored in all 3 variables (CHG1AY3=CHG2AY3=CHG3AY3).

In-district published tuition and required fees for 2012-13

IN-DISTRICT TUITION - The tuition charged by the institution to those students residing in the locality in which they attend school. This may be a lower rate than in-state tuition if offered by the institution.
TUITION AND REQUIRED FEES - Tuition is the amount of money charged to students for instructional services. Tuition may be charged per term, per course, or per credit.
Required fees are fixed sum charged to students for items not covered by tuition and required of such a large proportion of all students that the student who does NOT pay the charge is an exception. 
UNDERGRADUATE - A student enrolled in a 4- or 5-year bachelor's degree program, an associate's degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the baccalaureate. 
FULL-TIME Undergraduate - A student enrolled for 12 or more semester credits, or 12 or more quarter credits, or 24 or more contact hours a week each term 
FIRST-TIME FIRST-YEAR STUDENT - A student attending any institution for the first time at the undergraduate level. Includes students enrolled in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer term. Also includes students who entered with advanced standing (college credits earned before graduation from high school).
FIRST-YEAR STUDENT A student who has completed less than the equivalent of 1 full year of undergraduate work; that is, less than 30 semester hours (in a 120-hour degree program) or less than 900 contact hours. 
ACADEMIC YEAR - The period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to 2 semesters or trimesters, 3 quarters, or the period covered by a 4-1-4 plan. Also included are "Other Academic Calender Systems" which is a category used to describe "non-traditional" calendar systems at 4-year and 2-year degree-granting institutions. These can include schools that offer primarily on-line courses or "one course at a time". </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>100609</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived - IPEDS, Fall 2013, Institutional Characteristics component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Total cost of attendance</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Total cost of attendance</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVIC2013</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;46652</td><td>&nbsp;2700</td><td>&nbsp;18072</td><td>&nbsp;11683.52</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>ENRTOT - Total  enrollment</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Total men and women enrolled for credit in the fall of the academic year.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

For institutions that report the cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program, the cost of attendance is generated as stated above, but is then divided by the number of months to complete the program to produce a monthly cost of attendance. The average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid is also divided by 12 to produce a monthly average. The average net price is generated by subtracting the average monthly grant and scholarship aid from the average monthly cost of attendance and the difference is multiplied by the number of months to complete the program.
